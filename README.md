# Instagram - Who Does Not Follow Back

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a script that can be run and will compare your followers and following users on Instagram.
It will then create a file showing you the users that do not follow you back.

Why Use This Script:
* Will make your life easier
* You don't have to use shady 3rd party apps that may steal your data or IG account
* This is a safe app, it does not access your IG account in any way
* Will help you clean out accounts you follow that you may not want to follow any longer
* Let you figure out who unfollowed you and people you may also want to unfollow back :smile:
